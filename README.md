# Essential Coding Concepts
Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to **Essential Coding Concepts**, a curated collection of best practices and architectural patterns aimed at helping developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

This repository serves as a **developer knowledge hub**, consolidating best practices, coding standards, habits, and foundational concepts every developer should know. Whether you're a beginner looking to build strong coding habits or a seasoned programmer aiming to refine your skills, you'll find valuable guidance here.


## ðŸ“š What's Inside?

This guide is structured across several focused documents:

## 1. Thick Model / Fat Model
> A "Fat Model" or "Thick Model" architecture emphasizes placing business logic in the model layer instead of the controller or view. This keeps your code organized and makes testing and maintenance easier.

**Benefits:**
- Centralized business logic
- Easier to test and reuse
- Better separation of concerns

**Example:**  
#### Code Blocks (Indented style)

Indented 4 spaces, like `<pre>` (Preformatted Text).

    <?php
        echo "Hello world!";
    ?>
---

## 2. Skinny Controllers

> A "Skinny Controller" ensures your controllers handle as little logic as possible â€” just enough to delegate work to models or services.

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner code
- Easier debugging
- Promotes modularity

**Example:**  
#### Code Blocks (Indented style)

Indented 4 spaces, like `<pre>` (Preformatted Text).

    <?php
        echo "Hello world!";
    ?>
---
